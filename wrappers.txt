chocolate wrapper problem
You have 15 Rs with you. You go to a shop and shopkeeper tells you price as 1 Rs per chocolate. He also tells you that you can get a chocolate in return of 3 wrappers. How many maximum chocolates you can eat?


Answer: 22
Buy and eat 15 chocolates
Return 15 wrappers and get 5 more chocolates.
Return 3 wrappers, get 1 chocolate and eat it (keep 2 wrappers)
Now we have 3 wrappers. Return 3 and get 1 more chocolate.

So total chocolates = 15 + 5 + 1 + 1

program
# Recursive Python3 program to find
# maximum number of chocolates
import math

# Returns number of chocolates we can
# have from given number of chocolates
# and number of wrappers required to
# get a chocolate.
def countRec(choc, wrap):
	
	# If number of chocolates is less 
	# than number of wrappers required.
	if (choc < wrap):
		return 0;

	# We can immediately get newChoc
	# using wrappers of choc.
	newChoc = choc / wrap;

	# Now we have "newChoc + choc%wrap" wrappers.
	return newChoc + countRec(newChoc + choc %
								wrap, wrap);

# Returns maximum number of chocolates 
# we can eat with given money, price 
# of chocolate and number of wrappers 
# required to get a chocolate.
def countMaxChoco(money, price, wrap):
	
	# We can directly buy below 
	# number of chocolates
	choc = money / price;

	# countRec returns number
	# of chocolates we can
	# have from given number 
	# of chocolates
	return math.floor(choc + countRec(choc, wrap));

# Driver code

# total money
money = 15;
	
# cost of each candy
price = 1; 
	
# no of wrappers needs to be
wrap = 3 ; 
	
# exchanged for one chocolate.
print(countMaxChoco(money, price, wrap));
