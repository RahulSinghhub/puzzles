100 logical prisioners in raigads jail requested king to release them and show mercy
king agrees but on a condition that they have to solve the kings puzzle
prisioners agreed 
they are then taken to a dungeon where inside they are given hats to wear 
the colour of the hats are black and red 
they are then made to come out and form a group according to hat colours
if even one of them at the end is not in his hat colour group all the prisioners will be sent back to jail
how would the prisioners figure out a way to stand in his group


ans -  one prisioner comes out and stands    a
second prisioner doesnot know his hats colour he stands aside him
third prisioner comes and if he sees that both have same hat colour he would join them else if they are not he will go and make his own line

condition of same colour hat -----he would go and stand with them 
so they will understand and would also stand together 

else they would seperate and then fourth prisioner comes he sees if thirs is not similar to them he would also stand seperately ehich wuld also inform the third guy his hat colour
and so on this process repeats itself
