you have a flash torch 
you also have 8 cells
in that you have 4 good and 4 bad cells
how many times needed to distinguish  good from bad

ans--
make 3 groups of batteries 
3   3    2

we're assuming all (1,2,3) battries of first group is bad,there are 3 conditions {(1,2),(1,3),(2,3)}
then we go for second group ultimatly we have used 3 dead battries so we have only on dead btr that is btr no. 1
so in this it will chack (1,2),(1,3) after this when we use (2,3) it will start the torch
so in 6th times it will on 
???????????????????????????????????   dont know its correctc or not
